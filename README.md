# contamDE

The R package ‘contamDE’ conducts differential expression (DE) analysis using high throughput next-generation RNA-seq read count data generated from contaminated tumor samples and normal samples. Two methods are implemented in this R package, one is contamDE (Shen et al., 2016) and the other is contamDE-lm (Ji et al., 2019). 

Installation of the R package ‘contamDE’ in R:
